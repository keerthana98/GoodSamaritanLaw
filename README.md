# GoodSamaritanLaw


On March 30, 2016, the Supreme Court of India gave "force of law" to the guidelines for the protection of Good Samaritans issued by
the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The purpose of a Good Samaritan law is to provide legal protection to bystanders who 
come to the aid and rescue of victims of road crashes.It has been more than two years since the Supreme Court Judgement on Good 
Samaritan Law. 84% people are not aware of the Good Samaritan Law.

This project on Computer Graphics is an attempt to spread awareness of this law.
